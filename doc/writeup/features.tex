The core functionality of Agent is quite simple. Given a question or search
string, it identifies people in your social networks who might best be able to
provide you knowledge on that topic. A typical usage pattern might be the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Log in or create an account
\item Link account to data sources (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
\item Ask about a topic by filling in one of the template questions (e.g.\ ``I
want to learn about XXX'' or ``I want to travel to XXX'')
\item View sorted list of connections who are likely to be able to answer your
question.
\end{enumerate}

Possible extensions could include integrating with messaging platforms on the
various linked accounts, so that you can ask your question immediately and track
responses to those questions. Additionally, we can generalize the set of
questions that a user can ask. This would involve doing semantic analysis of the
question in order to identify the information the user is looking for.
